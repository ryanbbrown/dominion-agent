# dominion-agent
Attempt to implement a dominion agent using the [Pyminion](https://github.com/evanofslack/pyminion/tree/master) package. 

The PyPI version of the package doesn't have alchemy/seaside working; `master` on github appears to have it implemented.

The default interface for playing a game involves free-form input as opposed to being presented with all possible actions, so will likely build out my initial agent using the JS dominion implementation [link](https://github.com/andrewrk/dominion).

Player 1 currently has Workshop, Estate, and three Copper cards in hand. They just played Artisan to gain Workshop into their hand and are waiting for the decision to place a card on top of their deck.",
  "strategy": "Player 1 should aim to build an engine by increasing the number of useful Action and Treasure cards in the deck. Since Player 1 already has a good mix of Treasure and some Action cards, cycling through the deck efficiently and gaining valuable cards should be prioritized. Placing the weakest card from the hand on top of the deck allows Player 1 to maximize the effectiveness of the remaining hand and improve the quality of the next draw. In this case, the Estate card is the least useful for the immediate turn, whereas playing Workshop could help gain more useful cards.",

{ "explanation": "Discarding the Duchy will reduce the number of victory points in the hand, but it's a necessary move to comply with the Militia's effect. Discarding the Militia would be a bad idea, as it's a valuable action card. Discarding the Silver or Copper would reduce the potential coins for the next turn, but keeping the Duchy is not worth the risk of having to discard another valuable card. ", "move": 1 }

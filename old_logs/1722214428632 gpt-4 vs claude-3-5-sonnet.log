{ "explanation": "At this point in the game I should focus on getting more victory points as the Province pile has only 1 card left. Since there weren't enough coins to purchase Province, Duchy or even a Gold for future turns, an Estate is the best choice as it gives 1 victory point without disrupting my deck's card drawing performance significantly.", "move": 4 }

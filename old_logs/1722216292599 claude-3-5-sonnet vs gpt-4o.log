  "explanation": "Given our current position and the game state, buying a Province is the optimal move. We have exactly 8 coins available, which is the cost of a Province. Provinces are the highest-value victory cards, worth 6 points each. Since the game is in its later stages (only 2 Provinces left in the supply), focusing on victory points is crucial. This purchase will significantly boost our victory point total and potentially secure our lead.",

{ "explanation": "Since there is only one Province card left in the supply, and I have enough money to purchase it, doing so will end the game and I will win by having more victory points. Choosing the Province will result in 6 more victory points, therefore, giving me a total of 27 victory points. This selection gives me a strategic advantage as it prevents Player 1 from accruing more victory points on their turn.", "move": 17 }

{ "explanation": "With 3 coins available, I can afford to buy a card that costs 3 coins. Since I already have a strong deck with multiple Harbingers and a Province, I want to focus on adding more cards that can help me draw and play more efficiently. Harbinger is a great option as it allows me to draw a card and put a card from my discard pile onto my deck, which can help me set up future turns. Buying another Harbinger will also give me more opportunities to play it and take advantage of its ability.", "move": 3 }

  "summary": "Player 2 has just played a strong turn, drawing multiple cards with Laboratories and a Smithy, and generating 12 coins with Gold and Copper. They have 3 Provinces in hand/discard, while Player 1 has 2 Provinces. There is only 1 Province left in the supply, indicating the game is nearing its end.",
  "strategy": "With only 1 Province remaining and a 6-point lead, Player 2 should focus on ending the game quickly while maintaining their lead. Buying the last Province would secure the win, as it would both increase their lead and end the game immediately.",
  "moveExplanation": "Buying the last Province is the optimal move. It increases Player 2's lead to 9 points and ends the game, preventing any possibility of a comeback from Player 1.",
  "move": 16

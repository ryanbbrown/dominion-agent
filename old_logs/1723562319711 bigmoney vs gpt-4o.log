  "strategy": "Player 2 should focus on building their economy early by acquiring Treasure cards or useful cheap actions that can help with deck cycling and economy. Considering we have 4 coins, Poacher would be a good option since it provides flexibility in the early game with +1 Card, +1 Action, and +1 Coin, and its drawback is only relevant later in the game. Alternatively, Silver would be a more straightforward economic boost.",

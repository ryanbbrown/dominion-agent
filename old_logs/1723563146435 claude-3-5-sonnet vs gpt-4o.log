  "summary": "Player 2 has played several cards in this turn and still has one action left. They currently have a somewhat balanced deck with a particular emphasis on Council Room and Sentry. The Supply piles for Province and Village are running low, with only 2 Provinces left, indicating the game is likely nearing its end. Player 2 has a significantly lower victory point total than Player 1 (16 vs. 32), so they need to maximize their points quickly.",
  "strategy": "Given the current state, Player 2 should aim to accumulate as many victory points as possible in the few remaining turns. However, since they have 3 buys and 8 coins worth of cards in hand, playing Artisan to gain a valuable card like a Duchy or a 5-cost action card could help them continue to build their deck, keeping an eye on their ability to buy Provinces or Duchies. Afterwards, playing Poacher to generate additional coin before buying high-value cards is recommended.",
  "moveExplanation": "Playing Artisan will allow the player to gain a strong card like a Duchy or Sentry to maintain their buying power and trashing momentum. It also helps ensure their deck can continue to cycle effectively in subsequent turns.",

  "summary": "Player 2 has played a significant number of action cards and is now at the final stage of their turn where they can use Artisan to gain a card worth up to 5 coins. They have 2 Provinces, Sentry cards, and Council Rooms enabling them to draw their deck effectively. There are only 2 Provinces left in the Supply. Player 1 is ahead in victory points but has exhausted their hand and is reshuffling.",
  "strategy": "Given that there are only 2 Provinces left in the Supply and Player 2 has a strong draw engine, the strategy should be to focus on obtaining the remaining Provinces as quickly as possible. With the current hand and the end game approaching, gaining more powerful cards like Sentry or Council Room can help reach 8 coins reliably. Also, Player 2 should maintain control over the ability to draw their deck and increase buying power.",

  "strategy": "Since Player 2 has 9 coins and 3 buys available this turn, it would be advantageous to focus on maximizing victory points while maintaining the engine. An ideal approach here would be to buy a Province, given that there are only 2 left, which will considerably boost Player 2's points and bring them closer to closing the point gap. Additional purchases should support the engine and generate coins for future turns.",

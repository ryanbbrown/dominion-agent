  "summary": "The game is in the mid-stage with 1 Province remaining. Player 2 has a strong economy with Gold, Silver, and Poachers, as well as 3 Provinces already. Player 1 has 27 victory points, while Player 2 has 21. Player 2 currently has 8 coins to spend.",
  "strategy": "Player 2 should focus on gaining the last Province to end the game, as they are only 6 points behind Player 1. If unable to buy the Province, they should improve their deck with strong Action cards or more Gold to ensure they can buy the Province on their next turn.",
  "moveExplanation": "Buying the last Province will end the game and give Player 2 a chance to win, as they will be only 3 points behind Player 1 (27 vs 24). This is the optimal move given the current game state.",

  "summary": "Player 2 (27 victory points) is in the Buy phase with 4 Actions, 3 Buys, and 0 Coins. They have already played multiple action cards this turn and still have an Estate in hand. Available kingdom cards include Cellar, Moat, Merchant, Village, Bureaucrat, Gardens, Bandit, Festival, Market, and Witch.",
  "strategy": "Player 2 should maximize deck efficiency and aim to buy high-value cards when possible. Given their current position and the availability of Silver and Market, focusing on acquiring additional Silvers for consistent coin generation and Markets for additional Buy and coin opportunities would be beneficial. Since Player 2 currently has no available coins, ending the turn and focusing on maximizing future turns with strong draw and buy capabilities seem optimal.",
  "moveExplanation": "Without any money left to spend, buying a Copper or Curse would be detrimental. Ending the turn to reset and prepare for a stronger turn next time is the best move.",

Combining Silver for steady cash flow and a draw card like Smithy can also provide a reliable strategy.

Alternatively, a strong card like Witch could start building pressure on Player 1 by adding curses to their deck.",

  "summary": "Player 2 has accumulated 15 victory points, currently leads Player 1 by 1 point, and has built a deck with a strong treasure base (4 Gold, 1 Silver), a Witch for attack and draw, and a Village for additional actions. Five coppers have been trashed. Player 1 has 14 victory points and has been primarily buying Silver and Gold, with fewer action cards in general.",
  "strategy": "Player 2 should focus on purchasing Provinces as the primary goal while balancing the deck with support cards. The game is getting close to the end, and there are only 4 Provinces left. Given 10 coins this turn, buying a Province will move Player 2 closer to victory and make it harder for Player 1 to catch up.",

  "summary": "Player 2 has 21 victory points and has emphasized Gold and Witch in their strategy. Player 1 is at 20 victory points, focusing on accumulating Silvers and improving their Treasure economy. Player 2 currently has 6 coins to spend, 1 Action remaining, and they are ahead by 1 victory point. Only 2 Provinces remain in the Supply, indicating the game will likely end soon. Cursing via Witch has been effective for Player 2 to delay Player 1.",
  "strategy": "Given the limited number of Provinces left, focus on continuing to improve the economy to ensure you can buy the remaining Provinces or high-value cards quickly. An additional Gold would be valuable for ensuring consistent high purchasing power in the final rounds. Alternatively, a Duchy would secure some additional points but may slow down future buys. Since the Witch strategy has been beneficial, another Witch could also help to provide sustained pressure and additional card draw.",

The trash contains 5 coppers. Player 2 has already trashed some coppers with Moneylender. No other special cards are in play and both players have bought provinces recently.",
  "strategy": "Player 2 should focus on playing Village to increase their action count. This will allow them to follow up with Smithy to draw more cards, and then play their Golds for a strong buy phase. Given that there is only one province left, aiming to gain it immediately would be crucial to potentially end the game with an advantage.",
  "moveExplanation": "Playing Village first grants an additional action, allowing the play of Smithy without ending the action phase. This maximizes the chances of drawing more valuable cards, which can then be used to ensure that the last province can be bought if affordable, or at least getting closer to ending the game favorably.",

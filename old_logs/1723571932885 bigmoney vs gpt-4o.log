  "summary": "Player 2 is currently playing their turn and has drawn a hand of Gold, Poacher, Silver, Silver, and Chapel. Player 1 holds a significant lead with 23 victory points, while Player 2 has 6 victory points. The Province supply is low with only 2 remaining. Player 2 has successfully built a strong engine with multiple Villages and draw cards but needs to increase their point total quickly to catch up.",
  "strategy": "Player 2 should focus on maximizing their buys and coin output to purchase high-value victory cards like Provinces to close the gap with Player 1. Efficient use of their drawing and trashing capabilities is crucial to cycle through the deck more quickly to access strong cards recurrently throughout their turns.",
  "moveExplanation": "Discarding Chapel is the optimal choice since it doesn't contribute to the immediate generation of coins or actions this turn, and Player 2 has a significant overflow of actions already available.",

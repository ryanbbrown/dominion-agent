Since Chapel has already been purchased, the next step is to focus on building a more powerful deck. They should aim to start integrating stronger cards that will help in drawing more cards or adding actions, to maximize efficiency in the deck. In this early game stage, a card that complements the Chapel strategy while starting to build towards a functional engine is important.",

  "summary": "Player 2 is leading with 33 victory points, having bought multiple Provinces. Player 1 has 0 victory points, and currently has a thin deck focused on card draw and Throne Rooms, and has trashed their weaker cards. Player 1 has Chapel and Throne Room in hand, and can potentially use these to cycle through their deck more effectively in tandem with the Council Room they played.",
  "strategy": "Player 1 should aim to draw through as much of their deck as possible to accumulate enough coins for a high-value buy. Given that they have Throne Room in hand, they can double the action of Council Room, maximizing the number of cards they draw, which will help them purchase high-value cards like Province or Gold. Playing Throne Room on Chapel is less effective since they have already trashed most weak cards.",

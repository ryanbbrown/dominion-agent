The current game state shows the Supply has all cards available and no cards have been trashed yet.

  "strategy": "Since trashing cards early is very powerful, it would be beneficial to gain a card that can contribute to trashing those weak starting cards as soon as possible to streamline the deck. Given the current 4 coins, Moneylender can help Player 2 trash Coppers while contributing to their economy. This sets up a deck that more quickly cycles to more powerful cards and buys.",

Player 1 is behind with 6 victory points and fewer high-value cards.",

  "summary": "Player 2 currently has a stronger deck with a combination of attack, draw, and trashing capabilities. They have solid control over their deck due to Sentry and a Chapel, and they are in a decent position with 21 points. Player 1 is building a money-focused strategy but currently trails with 15 points. The Province pile is approaching depletion with only one card left, signaling the game could end soon.",
  "strategy": "Player 2 should maintain pressure on Player 1 while increasing deck reliability and efficiency. By playing Witch first, Player 2 can draw more cards and potentially increase coin count, while also adding a Curse to Player 1's deck. This would make the upcoming turns more challenging for Player 1. If Witch doesn't provide sufficient coins for a higher buy, Player 2 can then play Militia to gain coins and disrupt Player 1's hand.",
  "moveExplanation": "Playing Witch first maximizes card draw and potential extra coins, allowing for better planning for the remainder of the turn. Given the remaining actions, this move optimally leverages Player 2's deck capabilities.",

  "summary": "Player 2 has a significant lead with 21 victory points compared to Player 1's 14 victory points. The game is progressing towards an end with only 1 Province left in the supply, and Player 2 has developed a well-rounded deck with multiple high-value cards including Gold, Militia, Sentry, Smithy, and Witch. Player 2 also has ample trashing capabilities with Chapel.",
  "strategy": "Since there is only 1 Province left, prioritizing high-value purchases and ensuring the deck remains efficient is crucial. Player 2 should focus on buying the remaining Province to solidify the lead and potentially end the game. Player 2 has 9 coins and 2 buys, making this a feasible move.",
  "moveExplanation": "Buying the last Province secures 6 additional victory points and ends the game with a strong point lead. This move capitalizes on the current advantage and prevents Player 1 from gaining more points in subsequent turns.",

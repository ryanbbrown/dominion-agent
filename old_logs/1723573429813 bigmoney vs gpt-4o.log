Player 2 has a strong economy with multiple Golds and is leading with 9 victory points, including a Province. The supply piles still have a lot of cards left, and Player 1 currently has 2 coins and 2 buys.",
  "strategy": "Player 1 should continue to adapt their deck, focusing on gaining valuable cards quickly and efficiently using Remodel and Artisan, while using Festival and Workshop to complement that strategy. Since Festival provides 2 Actions and an extra Buy, and Player 1 already has one in play, it's optimal to gain as many valuable cards as possible. Given that it's early-to-middle game and Player 1 needs to catch up in victory points, gaining cards like Market and Council Room for better cycling and extra buys is crucial. Player 1 should play Workshop to gain a mid-cost card like Vassal, which can synergize with the existing Festivals and help draw into more actions.",
  "moveExplanation": "Playing Workshop allows Player 1 to gain a card costing up to 4 coins. Vassal is a good choice to keep the engine moving, as it has synergy with Festival and can help with money generation as well as the chance of playing additional Action cards.",

The goal should be to buy multiple Provinces in one turn. Since Player 1 has already played key engine cards (Festival, Markets, and Council Rooms), drawing additional Golds and high-value Action cards like Artisan will strengthen future turns. Trashing the remaining Estates and Coppers will also streamline the deck, increasing the consistency of engine turns.

  "summary": "Player 1 has played Festival, Market, and Artisan. Player 2 has been focusing on Provinces and already has significant victory points. There is only 1 Province left. Player 1 has a strategic advantage with multiple Action cards but is behind in points.",
  "strategy": "Player 1 should focus on using the Council Room to draw more cards to potentially set up for a stronger buying phase. Considering there are 3 buys and a potential to gain more coins, Player 1 should aim to maximize the coin output and try to end with a big purchase to stay competitive or force an endgame.",
  "moveExplanation": "Playing Council Room first will maximize card draw allowing Player 1 to potentially play more Action cards and accumulate more coins for a significant buy.",

{
  "summary": "Player 1 has a strong deck with multiple Council Rooms, Festivals, Markets, and an Artisan but is significantly behind in Victory Points (6 vs 39) compared to Player 2, who has purchased several Provinces. Player 1 has drawn a Province, Remodel, Vassal, and Moat, with 8 coins and 4 Buys remaining.",
  "strategy": "Player 1 needs to quickly catch up on Victory Points. Buying a Province right now is crucial to close the VP gap. Player 1 should also consider that there is only 1 Province left, which might end the game soon if Player 2 buys it. Further action buys like Duchy can also be helpful if Player 2 buys the last Province.",
  "moveExplanation": "Buying a Province maximizes the immediate increase in victory points and takes the last available Province to prevent Player 2 from ending the game with a potential win on their turn.",

  "summary": "Player 1 has played through most of their turn and now has no actions left and no coins with which to buy anything meaningful. Player 1 does have a strong engine setup with multiple Council Rooms, Markets, and Festivals being played, and has likely drawn through most of their deck. Provinces and Duchies are still available in sufficient quantity, but there are zero Provinces left. Player 2 is ahead on victory points and also has a significant lead in Provinces.",
  "strategy": "Player 1 should focus on getting back to their strong engine setup and accumulating more victory points. Since the turn is ending and no meaningful actions or buys can be made without coins, Player 1 should end the turn and strategize to buy Duchies in future turns to gain more victory points since Provinces are out.",
  "moveExplanation": "Ending the turn is the only viable option as Player 1 has no coins left to make any useful purchases. Movement for the future involves maintaining and leveraging their engine to continuously buy Duchies and potentially Estates to close the gap on victory points.",
